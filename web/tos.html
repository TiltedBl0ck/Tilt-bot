            <h3>1. Acceptance of Terms</h3>
            <p>By inviting, adding, or using the "Tilt-bot" Discord bot ("the Bot") in your Discord server, you are agreeing to be bound by these Terms of Service ("TOS"). If you do not agree with any part of these terms, you must remove the Bot from your server and cease its use immediately.</p>

            <h3>2. Description of Service</h3>
            <p>Tilt-bot provides a range of features including but not limited to server moderation, utility commands, AI-powered chat via the Gemini API, and server management functions ("the Service"). The features offered may be added, modified, or removed at any time without prior notice.</p>

            <h3>3. User Responsibilities and Conduct</h3>
            <p>You agree not to use the Bot for any purpose that is unlawful, malicious, or prohibited by these terms or by Discord's own Terms of Service. Prohibited actions include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Harassing, abusing, or threatening other users through the Bot's functionalities.</li>
                <li>Distributing spam, unsolicited messages, or malicious content.</li>
                <li>Attempting to exploit, disrupt, or gain unauthorized access to the Bot's services or underlying infrastructure.</li>
                <li>Using the AI features to generate hateful, dangerous, or sexually explicit content.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The owner of the server is responsible for how the Bot is used within their server. Misuse may result in a temporary or permanent ban from using the Service.</p>

            <h3>4. Disclaimer of Warranties</h3>
            <p>The Bot is provided "as is" and "as available" without any warranties, express or implied. We do not guarantee that the Bot will be uninterrupted, secure, or error-free at all times. All features are used at your own risk.</p>

            <h3>5. Limitation of Liability</h3>
            <p>In no event shall the creators or maintainers of Tilt-bot be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages resulting from the use or inability to use the Service.</p>
